\noindent

%I provide solutions for Business process automation, data pipelines, web-based tools for supply chain risk assessment, and scraping
%web repositories to obtain research data. I provide machine learning, data analysis, and process automation solutions 
%in Python for an engineering team in the domain of supply chain risk analysis. I also interpret the results of the findings and 
%communicate directly to stakeholders â€” customers, my internal organization, and the public.

Using the Python 3 language, I have implemented Machine Learning solutions for risk assessment, automated business processes, and built applications to scrape web repositories for research data.
These tools are used by Intertek's Global Restricted Substances (\acr{GRS}) group to provide supply chain risk analysis for manufacturers as part of regulatory certification.
I interpret the results of the findings and communicate directly to stakeholders --- customers, my internal organization, and the public.\\

\headerone{Selected Professional Projects}

   \headertwo{Material Risk Analysis Application }
   \projectLine{Purpose: }{ 
   Analyzes a customer's supply chain for material risks. Evaluated multi-class machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayesian Classifier, 
   Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest to determine the types of materials used in a product based on text extracted from its 
   design files. Renders a tabular report with recommended testing plan or design revisions, to assist a material science \acr{SME}. 
   Deployed in a Flask application using a \acr{REST} \acr{API}. }
   \projectLine{Results: }{Reduced a multi-week engineering workflow to hours.  Allows customers to apply chemical testing in a targeted, cost-effective manner.  
   718 successful customer-projects to date.}
